## Typography

##### Part 1

* We read primarily by recognizing the overall shape of words, not by parsing each letter and then assembling a recognizable word

* Avoid all-uppercase headlines they are much harder to read, because words formed with capital letters are monotonous rectangles that offer few distinctive shapes to catch the reader's eye

*  In general, use down style (capitalize only the first word, and any proper nouns) for your headlines and subheads. Down style headlines are more legible, because we primarily scan the tops of words as we read

* If you use initial capital letters in your headlines you disrupt the reader's scanning of the word forms


#### Part 2

* the lines of text in most Web pages are much too long to be easily read

* The exact character count is difficult to predict because of the way different browser software and different operating systems display type sizes. In conventional print layout columns of 30 to 40 characters per line are considered ideal, but this seems too sparse to our eyes for Web page layout
