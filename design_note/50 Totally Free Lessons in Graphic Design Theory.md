## Typography

##### Part 1

* We read primarily by recognizing the overall shape of words, not by parsing each letter and then assembling a recognizable word

* Avoid all-uppercase headlines they are much harder to read, because words formed with capital letters are monotonous rectangles that offer few distinctive shapes to catch the reader's eye

*  In general, use down style (capitalize only the first word, and any proper nouns) for your headlines and subheads. Down style headlines are more legible, because we primarily scan the tops of words as we read

* If you use initial capital letters in your headlines you disrupt the reader's scanning of the word forms


#### Part 2

* the lines of text in most Web pages are much too long to be easily read

* The exact character count is difficult to predict because of the way different browser software and different operating systems display type sizes. In conventional print layout columns of 30 to 40 characters per line are considered ideal, but this seems too sparse to our eyes for Web page layout


## Five simple steps to better typography

#### Measure the Measure

* A general good rule of thumb is 2-3 alphabets in length, or 52-78 characters (including spaces). This is for legibility purposes. Keep your Measure within these guidelines and you should have no problem with legibility

* Small Measure, less leading. Wide Measure, more leading

* eg white text on black, make sure you increase the leading, tracking and decrease your font-weight. This applies to all widths of Measure

* The general rule of thumb in tracking your words (not the characters) is that the shorter the line length the tighter the tracking, the opposite is also true.

#### Hanging Punctuation

Hang lists and hang quotation marks, when using pull quotes and quotes within a body of text.



## Grid Based Design

#### Designing With Grid-Based Approach

* The grid is the most vivid manifestation of the will to order in graphic design. [...] Units are the basic buildung block of a grid. They’re all uniform. Columns are the grouping of units that create the visual structure of the page. They are not necessary uniform

* A grid is a consistent system for placing objects. It works on two levels: At the unit level of cells (e.g. 20×20 pixels) and at the column level (e.g. 4 columns).

* Short elements are extended to begin and end on grid boundaries, while long elements are allowed to span multiple grid units or are shortened to fit within the standard unit

* One of the most effective principles in grid design is called the Rule of Thirds, also known as the golden grid rule. The Rule of Thirds is a technique which is applied by dividing a space into thirds, both vertically and horizontally, creating a grid of rectangles.

* the Golden Ratio is the ratio between two segments so that the ratio between point ac/bc is 1.618

* Grid Structures: Once you have answered most of the questions regarding the content, format and typography, you should begin sketching out grid structures based on the appropriate page sizes and formats. You should first begin by defining the Type Area. The Type Area is the area where your grid will be contained. It is surrounded on all sides by margins and in some cases running heads and page footers, numbers, marginalia, etc

* The main principle of the baseline grid is that the bottom of every line of text (the baseline) falls on a vertical grid set in even increments all the way down the page

* You can use relative sizes, but it quickly becomes a lot more difficult to maintain as the math becomes more complicated. It’s easy to get 12 out of 18 (just set the line-height to 1.5em), but when you want to adjust the text size but keep the same line-height, the fractions start to get messy

* Table layouts are great for grid designs

* In your page layout, you’ve probably set margins. These margins often show up as light solid or dashed lines on the screen. These top, bottom, left, and right margins create a box in the middle of your page. Stop there and you have a single unit grid. Further divide the page into uniform parts and you’ve created a multiple unit grid

* 1, 2, and 3 column grids are common. Each can accommodate lots of text, especially long articles. [..] 4 or more columns offer greater flexibility for publications with text, photos, and other graphic elements and a mix of long and short articles. [..] Grids based on an even number of grid columns can suffer from too much symmetry if text and graphics are confined to individual or double grid columns throughout.


#### Five simple steps to designing grid systems 

* The Golden Section is a ratio which is evident throughout the universe as the number Phi. You can use this ratio to good effect in design by making sure that elements of your grid conform to this ratio.
