## Typography

##### Part 1

* We read primarily by recognizing the overall shape of words, not by parsing each letter and then assembling a recognizable word

* Avoid all-uppercase headlines they are much harder to read, because words formed with capital letters are monotonous rectangles that offer few distinctive shapes to catch the reader's eye

*  In general, use down style (capitalize only the first word, and any proper nouns) for your headlines and subheads. Down style headlines are more legible, because we primarily scan the tops of words as we read

* If you use initial capital letters in your headlines you disrupt the reader's scanning of the word forms


#### Part 2

* the lines of text in most Web pages are much too long to be easily read

* The exact character count is difficult to predict because of the way different browser software and different operating systems display type sizes. In conventional print layout columns of 30 to 40 characters per line are considered ideal, but this seems too sparse to our eyes for Web page layout


## Five simple steps to better typography

#### Measure the Measure

* A general good rule of thumb is 2-3 alphabets in length, or 52-78 characters (including spaces). This is for legibility purposes. Keep your Measure within these guidelines and you should have no problem with legibility

* Small Measure, less leading. Wide Measure, more leading

* eg white text on black, make sure you increase the leading, tracking and decrease your font-weight. This applies to all widths of Measure

* The general rule of thumb in tracking your words (not the characters) is that the shorter the line length the tighter the tracking, the opposite is also true.

#### Hanging Punctuation

Hang lists and hang quotation marks, when using pull quotes and quotes within a body of text.



## Grid Based Design

#### Designing With Grid-Based Approach

* The grid is the most vivid manifestation of the will to order in graphic design. [...] Units are the basic buildung block of a grid. They’re all uniform. Columns are the grouping of units that create the visual structure of the page. They are not necessary uniform

* A grid is a consistent system for placing objects. It works on two levels: At the unit level of cells (e.g. 20×20 pixels) and at the column level (e.g. 4 columns).

* Short elements are extended to begin and end on grid boundaries, while long elements are allowed to span multiple grid units or are shortened to fit within the standard unit

* One of the most effective principles in grid design is called the Rule of Thirds, also known as the golden grid rule. The Rule of Thirds is a technique which is applied by dividing a space into thirds, both vertically and horizontally, creating a grid of rectangles.

* the Golden Ratio is the ratio between two segments so that the ratio between point ac/bc is 1.618

* Grid Structures: Once you have answered most of the questions regarding the content, format and typography, you should begin sketching out grid structures based on the appropriate page sizes and formats. You should first begin by defining the Type Area. The Type Area is the area where your grid will be contained. It is surrounded on all sides by margins and in some cases running heads and page footers, numbers, marginalia, etc

* The main principle of the baseline grid is that the bottom of every line of text (the baseline) falls on a vertical grid set in even increments all the way down the page

* You can use relative sizes, but it quickly becomes a lot more difficult to maintain as the math becomes more complicated. It’s easy to get 12 out of 18 (just set the line-height to 1.5em), but when you want to adjust the text size but keep the same line-height, the fractions start to get messy

* Table layouts are great for grid designs

* In your page layout, you’ve probably set margins. These margins often show up as light solid or dashed lines on the screen. These top, bottom, left, and right margins create a box in the middle of your page. Stop there and you have a single unit grid. Further divide the page into uniform parts and you’ve created a multiple unit grid

* 1, 2, and 3 column grids are common. Each can accommodate lots of text, especially long articles. [..] 4 or more columns offer greater flexibility for publications with text, photos, and other graphic elements and a mix of long and short articles. [..] Grids based on an even number of grid columns can suffer from too much symmetry if text and graphics are confined to individual or double grid columns throughout.


#### Five simple steps to designing grid systems 

* The Golden Section is a ratio which is evident throughout the universe as the number Phi. You can use this ratio to good effect in design by making sure that elements of your grid conform to this ratio. 

* Well designed grid systems can make your designs not only more beautiful and legible, but more usable

* The canvas size for print design is determined by the media size - paper, signage, envelope, whatever. The canvas size for fixed grid design on the web is normally determined by the browser window size, which is in turn determined by the user’s screen resolution. These are not fixed. Therefore a designer should design to the minimum requirement, which is normally the average screen resolution for the majority of users

* Gutters are the gaps in between columns.Generally the columns we create, using Web Standards, are ‘divs’ which are given widths and positioned and styled using CSS. So, ideally, if we’re creating these columns, we don’t want to be creating seperate ones for the gutters. We therefore deal with gutters as part of columns and they are implemented using padding, or creating margins, on elements positioned within them, or sometimes the column divs themselves

* Fixed width designs are, well, just easier to produce. The designer has control over the measure, and therefore the legibility (until the user increases or decreases the font size that is).
Flexible width designs scale to the user’s resolution, and therefore the browser window. There is less empty space, typically at the side of fixed width designs.

* Grid systems can be constructed from ratios. Simple ratios such as 1:3, or 2:1 are called rational ratios. More complex ratios, such as those based on the Golden Section (1: 1.618) , are called irrational ratios.


#### Grids: Order Out of Chaos

* A grid is an invisible structure used to guide the placement of elements on your page. Grids don't appear on the printed piece but their influence may be evident in the widths of column texts, the uniformity of space around photographs, or the consistent placement of repeating elements from page to page in a magazine. They are a series of guidelines that determine the margins of the piece, space between page elements (headlines, body text, photographs, etc.), and let you know where to put things on the blank page.

* There are many ways to establish visual unity throughout a series of related pieces. You probably use your logo on all your marketing pieces. You may have color coded brochures for different aspects of your business. Grids are another way to bring unity and cohesiveness to a collection of brochures, sales sheets, display ads, spec sheets, and other elements of your marketing arsenal.

* Grids have been accused of creating boring, static designs. It's not the fault of the grid. Used properly, grids can offer a variety of creative design options. 

* There are no right or wrong grids, simply grids that are more suitable for different content and design objectives. Of course that doesn't help you much when you're staring at a blank page and a deadline. Here are some "thinking points" to help you plan your grid and your design.

* Content or Page Elements.
Is the publication heavy on text or heavy on graphics? Will there be many headlines, rules, illustrations, pull-quotes?

* Text.
Look at both amount of text and how it is broken down — long articles, lots of short articles, a mix of long and short articles. How many subheads? Will you use eyebrows, decks, initial caps, and other visual cues?

* Photos and Illustrations.
Are there similarities in the type of illustrations or size of photos? Can photos be grouped by size or type? Are there a lot of rectangular elements or many irregularly shaped elements?

* Complexity.
Generally the larger the number of grid units (and the smaller the individual units) the more design options are available. However, too many options can destroy the underlying unity that the grid provides.

* Here are some guidelines

Lots of text with few graphics — such as a book with long chapters and few or no illustrations — can use a simpler grid. 1 - 3 units, perhaps.
A newsletter, brochure, or magazine with many photographs usually requires a grid with many smaller units to give more possiblities for placing and sizing the photographs.
Newsletters, because they generally have more text, often use a columnar grid.
1, 2, and 3 column grids are common. Each can accommodate lots of text, especially long articles.
4 or more columns offer greater flexibility for publications with text, photos, and other graphic elements and a mix of long and short articles.
Grids based on an even number of grid columns can suffer from too much symmetry if text and graphics are confined to individual or double grid columns throughout.
Newsletter don't have to be tied to columnar grids. A newsletter consisting of mostly small articles or "news briefs" and photos could use a 6(2x3), 9(3x3), or 12(3x4) unit grid of rectangular or square units quite nicely.


* Grids don't have to limit design.Grids can feel stifling. But they needn't be.
