# Practical use of HTML5 localStorage

* Caching data from an online web application so that the application can be used in offline scenarios (albeit with only the cached data).

* Persisting user specific UI state like what page a user is on, scroll position, etc. (if you really wanted to do that kind of thing).

* Persisting transient data in a web application (i.e. A user partially fills out a form and then navigates to another page in your application then decides to come back. You can allow them to pick up where they left off).

* Allow a user to enter data in your app while offline and then send the data to the server in the background next time the user is online.
